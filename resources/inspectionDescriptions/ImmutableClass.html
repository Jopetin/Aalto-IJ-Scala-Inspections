    Reports any calls to methods from side-effect free / immutable classes whose result is not stored or used further.
    This is to avoid mistakes where side-effect-free methods are mistaken as effectful.
    Side-effect free / immutable classes are recognized from a custom annotation with the name configured below.

    Example of wrong usage:

<pre>
<code>
class SideEffectFree extends StaticAnnotation

@SideEffectFree
class TestClass():
    def method(): Int =
        0

def main(): Int =
    val testObject = TestClass()
    testObject.method()
    0
